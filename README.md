# NLW2-Proffy

This is an project made on the Next Level Week event promoted by Rocketseat.

The project consist of a website with mobile first design in mind and an app for mobile, that would connect teachers with students.

The website and app were made with react, and the server that would keep the registers of the teachers (and so far, only teachers) with node.



Extra modules:

Axios was used on website and the mobile app was Axios for the services.
The app also uses expo as his base framework.

Node used express for the basic framework, and also Knex for SQL querys.


Installation:

Use yarn to install dependencies (npm commands probably should work too), once done, on the server folder open an terminal and uses yarn start to create a local server.

Both web and mobile, a yarn start will also begin the apps, with mobile using the expos browser interface.




Final toughts:

So far, this project can be improved a lot, and there's some points to be fixed (the week days on the mobile app are an example) i will return here as time comes by.
